This chapter elaborates on the research methodology for the development and evaluation process of an AI-enhanced Web-based MMSE application.

Design Science Research (DSR) is highly suitable for developing and testing such a novel IT artifact in the healthcare sector. DSR is a problem-solving paradigm that seeks to create and evaluate IT artifacts designed to solve identified organizational problems \cite{Hevner2004,Peffers2007}. DSR involves six core activities: problem identification, solution definition, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication \cite{Peffers2007}. In the context of AI-powered healthcare solutions, DSR provides a structured framework for addressing complex, multifaceted challenges while ensuring rigorous evaluation and practical relevance \cite{Gregor2013}. This thesis employs the DSR approach, covering all six activities, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Problem Identification:} The limitations of traditional MMSE were identified and analyzed.

    \item \textbf{Solution Definition:} To address the identified limitations, an AI-powered, web-based MMSE tool was proposed. This solution aims to enhance efficiency, standardization, accessibility, adaptability, longitudinal tracking, sensitivity, data security, and integration with existing health record systems.

    \item \textbf{Design and Development:} The design phase involved transforming traditional MMSE tasks into automated versions suitable for digital administration. The development phase utilized Java-based Spring Boot for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and AI models for various tasks.

    \item \textbf{Demonstration:} The tool, currently a proof of concept, was tested on a local machine to demonstrate its functionality and usability. Healthcare professionals could potentially initiate tests, patients would provide responses, AI models would analyze these responses, and results would be presented for evaluation in future deployments.

    \item \textbf{Evaluation:} The performance, usability, and effectiveness of the tool were assessed through initial feedback, testing on the local machine, and performance indicators such as test completion rate, assessment duration, and score consistency.

    \item \textbf{Communication:} The findings and outcomes were communicated through this thesis, and future research papers and presentations. Feedback from these communications will be used for continuous improvement of the tool.
\end{enumerate}

By systematically following these six main DSR activities, the creation and use of the AI-powered web-based MMSE can solve the problems that have been pointed out, ensuring thorough testing and usefulness in cognitive assessment methods. Figure \ref{fig:dsr-process} illustrates the iterative process of DSR, highlighting the key stages from problem identification to communication of results.

\subsection{Problem Identification}

Designing a Web-based AI-powered MMSE requires understanding the existing challenges to cognitive assessment and the needs of stakeholders. The limitations of traditional MMSE identified earlier provide the context for the proposed solution.

\subsubsection{MMSE Limitations}

Several limitations exist in current MMSE administrations, which reduce its effectiveness and popularity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Constraints:} Traditional MMSE administration requires approximately 10–15 minutes per patient, which can be problematic in busy clinical settings \cite{Folstein1975}.
    
    \item \textbf{Scoring Inconsistencies:} Manual scoring introduces the potential for human error and inconsistencies between administrators \cite{Tombaugh1992}.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Accessibility:} The need for in-person administration restricts access for patients in remote or underserved areas \cite{Bauer2012}.
    
    \item \textbf{Cultural and Educational Bias:} The standard MMSE may not account for cultural differences or varying educational backgrounds, potentially leading to inaccurate assessments \cite{Cullen2007}.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Longitudinal Tracking:} Traditional methods often fail to efficiently track cognitive changes over time \cite{Goldberg2015}.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Sensitivity:} The MMSE may not detect subtle cognitive changes, particularly in early stages of cognitive decline \cite{Mitchell2009}.
\end{itemize}

These limitations underscore the need for an innovative approach to cognitive assessment to address these challenges while maintaining or improving the validity and reliability of the test.

\subsubsection{Needs Assessment}

Based on identified limitations in the literature and analysis of the field, this research compiles a list of key requirements for an AI-powered cognitive assessment tool:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Efficiency:} Reduce administration time without compromising test validity.
\item \textbf{Standardization:} Ensure consistent test administration and scoring across different settings.
\item \textbf{Accessibility:} Enable remote administration to reach underserved populations.
\item \textbf{Adaptability:} Accommodate cultural and educational differences through dynamic test adjustments.
\item \textbf{Longitudinal Tracking:} Facilitate easy monitoring of cognitive changes over time.
\item \textbf{Data Security:} Implement robust measures to protect patient data and ensure privacy.
\end{itemize}
These requirements guide the design and development process of the AI-powered web-based MMSE, ensuring that the resulting tool addresses the key needs identified in the literature and aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cognitive assessment methods.

\subsection{Artifact Design and Development Process}

The AI-powered web-based Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) application employs a modern, scalable architecture designed to meet the needs identified in the problem identification phase. This section details the system's design, including its overall architecture, key components, and the assessment process flow.

\subsubsection{Conceptualizing the MMSE and System Design}

The conceptual design of the AI-powered web-based MMSE application involved transforming traditional MMSE tasks into automated versions suitable for digital administration. This process aimed to maintain the integrity of the original assessment \cite{Folstein1975} while leveraging the capabilities of web-based technologies and artificial intelligence \cite{Bauer2012, Zygouris2017}. As cognitive assessment tasks transition from paper-based to web-based administration, it is important to consider the test's psychometric properties and how the digital medium might affect test performance \cite{Geddes2020}. The details of the traditional MMSE tasks are provided in the appendix\footnote{See Appendix \ref{appendix:mmse} for the details of the traditional MMSE tasks.}.

\subsubsection{Challenges and Solutions in Automating MMSE Tasks}

Automating the MMSE tasks involved several challenges, requiring careful consideration of the limitations and capabilities of current technology. Below are detailed descriptions of the problems encountered and the solutions implemented for each task category:

\textbf{Orientation:} Traditionally, the tester asks the individual verbal questions related to time and place (e.g., "What is the date today?" or "Where are we right now?"). Points are given based on the accuracy of the responses. In the automated version, multiple choice questions are used to assess these aspects. The system presents questions related to time and place, and the user selects the correct answer from a list of options. This approach ensures accurate scoring and immediate feedback, facilitating the assessment process.

\textbf{Registration:} In the traditional MMSE, the individual is asked to repeat three words (e.g., "apple, penny, table"). The automated version uses image recognition and multiple choice to realize this task. The user is shown images corresponding to the words and must select the correct ones. If the user incorrectly identifies the images, the system provides immediate feedback and logs the response for further evaluation.

\textbf{Attention and Calculation:} Traditionally, tasks like serial subtraction (e.g., subtracting 7 from 100) or spelling words backward are used. In the automated version, numeric input fields are provided for tasks such as subtraction. The system processes the input, checking for correct and incorrect answers, and provides feedback accordingly. Incorrect answers are noted, and hints or step-by-step guidance can be offered to help the user understand the mistake.

\textbf{Recall:} This task involves recalling three previously mentioned words. In the automated version, the user inputs their answers into text fields. The system uses text recognition to evaluate the responses, allowing for common misspellings or variations in phrasing. Correct answers are scored, and incorrect ones prompt the user to try again or move to the next task with feedback.

\textbf{Language:} Naming objects traditionally involves the individual looking at an object and naming it (e.g., "What is this?"). The automated version utilizes image recognition combined with text input. The user views an image and types the name of the object. The system evaluates the input for correctness, taking into account synonyms and common spelling errors.

\textbf{Repetition:} The traditional task requires the individual to repeat a phrase. In the automated version, voice input is used, and the spoken response is transcribed by AI. The transcription is then evaluated for accuracy. Incorrect repetitions are flagged, and the user is asked to try again or move on with feedback.

\textbf{Complex Commands:} This task typically involves a three-stage command (e.g., "Take a paper in your right hand, fold it in half, and put it on the floor"). The automated version uses a drag-and-drop interface where users must complete tasks by dragging and placing items as instructed. The system tracks each action and scores it for accuracy, providing immediate feedback for any mistakes.

\textbf{Reading:} The individual is asked to read and follow a written command (e.g., "Close your eyes"). The automated system presents the command as text and requests a confirmation from the user upon understanding. The system evaluates the response to ensure comprehension.

\textbf{Writing:} Traditionally, the individual writes a sentence. In the automated version, the user inputs the sentence into a text field. The system uses AI to check the grammar and structure of the sentence, providing feedback on any errors and scoring the response accordingly.

\textbf{Visuospatial Skills:} The traditional task involves copying a design. The automated version provides a drawing interface where users draw using a mouse or touchscreen. AI analyzes the drawing for accuracy against a reference design. Feedback is provided based on the correctness and completeness of the drawing.

By addressing these challenges, the MMSE application provides a robust, automated solution for cognitive assessments, leveraging modern web technologies and advanced AI capabilities to ensure accuracy and reliability in its assessments.

\item \textbf{Integration Testing:} Tests for API endpoints and service interactions ensured correct behavior when combining components, particularly for validating the integration of AI models with the application logic.
\item \textbf{Manual Testing:} Regular manual testing sessions verified the user interface, user experience, and general functionality of the application.
\item \textbf{Accessibility Considerations:} The development process incorporated best practices for web accessibility, guided by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) \cite{wcag}.
\end{itemize}

Dependabot integration into the GitHub repository maintained up-to-date dependencies and addressed potential security vulnerabilities \cite{dependabot}. Dependabot automatically created pull requests to update outdated dependencies, ensuring that the project benefited from the latest library versions and security patches.

\paragraph{Code Quality, Monitoring, and Error Tracking}
Several tools were integrated into the development process to maintain the quality and consistency of the code:
\begin{itemize}
\item ESLint for JavaScript linting;
\item Prettier for code formatting;
\item SonarLint for identifying and fixing code quality issues.
\end{itemize}

These tools were primarily used within the IntelliJ IDEA development environment, providing real-time feedback during coding. ESLint and Prettier configurations were defined in IntelliJ, allowing immediate code style and quality checks as developers wrote the code.

While not implemented in a production environment, the development process considered future monitoring and error tracking:
\begin{itemize}
\item Plans for log aggregation using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) aimed at centralized log management and analysis \cite{elk}.
\item Considerations for integration with error tracking services such as Sentry aimed at real-time error monitoring and reporting in production environments \cite{sentry}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Database and Performance}
The PostgreSQL database schema was designed to efficiently store and retrieve test data, user information, and assessment results. Key entities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item User management (mmse\_user, mmse\_authority, mmse\_user\_authority);
    \item Test management (test\_entity, user\_answer, patient\_profile, test\_entity\_hash, media\_recording);
    \item AI integration (dolphin\_question, orientation\_to\_place\_answer).
\end{itemize}

This enhanced schema includes relationships and indexing strategies to ensure optimal performance and data integrity. Figure \ref{fig:database-schema} provides a detailed view of the database schema, illustrating the relationships between key entities such as user management, test management, and AI integration components.

\end{itemize}

This implementation process ensured the development of a secure, efficient, and user-friendly AI-powered web-based MMSE application, leveraging modern technologies to enhance cognitive assessment practices.

In conclusion, the artifact design and development process for the AI-powered web-based MMSE application leveraged modern software engineering practices to ensure efficient and high-quality development. The combination of iterative development, version control, automated testing, and continuous integration enabled the creation of a reliable and scalable application poised to revolutionize cognitive assessment practices.

\subsubsection{Assessment Process and AI Integration}

The use of the application follows a structured process for administering the MMSE, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:assessment-flow}. This process consists of the following steps:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.34\textwidth]{simplified-flow.png}
\caption{A detailed view of the interactions and data flow during the assessment process.}
\label{fig:assessment-flow}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Test initiation by the healthcare professional}: The clinician initiates the assessment by generating a unique link for the patient.
    \item \textbf{Patient information collection}: The patient accesses the assessment through the provided link, and the system loads or resumes the current state.
    \item \textbf{Administration of the MMSE through sequential question presentation}: The patient answers various types of questions, including Multiple Choice, Text, Voice, and Drawing. These interactions are captured in the "Patient Interaction" partition of the diagram.
    \item \textbf{Answer collection through various input methods}: Once the patient answers a question, the response is temporarily stored on the frontend. Upon submission of the response by the patient, the system initiates the transition to backend processing. This is a critical juncture in the workflow as indicated by the direct link from "Response Submitted" to the decision node (diamond).
    \item \textbf{AI-powered analysis of patient responses}: At the decision node, the system evaluates whether the submitted response requires AI processing. This decision is based on the type of response and the nature of the question answered by the patient.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{If AI processing is required}: The system routes the response to the appropriate AI model. For instance:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Llama 3.1:70b} for complex language comprehension.
            \item \textbf{ChatGPT 4o} for processing drawings.
            \item \textbf{Specialized models} for speech-to-text, synonym detection, and semantic understanding.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textit{If AI processing is not required}: The response undergoes standard processing, bypassing the AI models.
    \end{itemize}
    After processing, whether through AI or standard methods, the response is stored in the database. This ensures that all responses are securely saved for future analysis and score calculation.
    \item \textbf{Generation of clinical insights and result presentation}: Scores are calculated periodically, incorporating concurrency control to manage simultaneous access and updates. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the assessment scores. The calculated scores are updated in the database, ensuring that the most recent assessment results are available for review. Finally, the clinician reviews the results of the MMSE, providing a comprehensive overview of the patient’s cognitive state.
\end{enumerate}

This workflow integrates the roles of healthcare professionals, patients, and the AI-enhanced MMSE Tool, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient assessment process.

\subsection{Evaluation Approach}
Assessing the AI-driven web-based MMSE system is essential to verify its efficiency, precision, and user-friendliness compared to conventional techniques. This framework presents a targeted method to evaluate system performance and user interaction through expert assessment \cite{Greenhalgh2017}.

\subsubsection{Performance Indicators}
Experts assess the performance of the AI-powered web-based MMSE application. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Test Completion Rate:} Percentage of assessments completed without technical issues, as observed by experts.
\item \textbf{Assessment Duration:} Average time taken to complete the MMSE, recorded by experts.
\item \textbf{Score Consistency:} Correlation between AI-generated scores and expert evaluator scores.
\item \textbf{Expert Feedback:} Qualitative feedback from experts on the usability and effectiveness of the web-based system.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Expert Evaluation Process}
A group of 3-5 evaluators with backgrounds in software development and/or user experience design will be recruited to assess the application. The evaluation process will include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Comparative Assessment:} Experts will interact with both the AI-powered web-based MMSE and a traditional paper-based MMSE for comparison \cite{Bauer2012}.
\item \textbf{System Usability Scale (SUS):} Evaluators will complete the SUS questionnaire after using the web-based MMSE, providing quantitative feedback on usability and efficiency \cite{Brooke1996}.
\item \textbf{Prototype Testing:} Evaluators will complete a full MMSE assessment using the web-based application, allowing for observations on task completion times and any technical issues encountered \cite{Zygouris2017}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{User Experience Assessment}
To evaluate the user experience of the AI-powered web-based MMSE, we will gather feedback from experts through:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Semi-structured Interviews:} Brief interviews with the evaluators will capture qualitative insights on the application's strengths, potential areas for improvement, and overall impressions \cite{Wild2021}.
\item \textbf{User Satisfaction Survey:} A survey based on the SUS will assess the overall satisfaction with the web-based system from the perspective of experts \cite{Brooke1996}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Analysis}
Data from this evaluation will be analyzed using basic descriptive statistics for the SUS scores and qualitative analysis of interview responses \cite{Braun2006}. This approach will provide initial insights into the application's usability and potential effectiveness, while also identifying areas for future development and more comprehensive evaluation.

It is important to note that this evaluation is a preliminary assessment and does not constitute a full clinical validation of the tool. A more comprehensive evaluation involving healthcare professionals and a larger, diverse participant group is required for future work \cite{Geddes2020}.
