The demographic landscape of Europe is rapidly aging, and Eurostat projects that the population aged 65 and older will reach 29.4\% by 2050 \cite{Eurostat2020}. This shift correlates with an increase in age-related cognitive impairments. Dementia cases in Europe are expected to nearly double to 18.85 million by 2050 \cite{AlzheimerEurope2019}.

This increased prevalence puts a heavy toll on healthcare and the wider community. Early identification and intervention can make a highly relevant difference in the process of cognitive decline, hence improving quality of life and reducing the burden on health care \cite{Livingston2020}. Cognitive assessment tests are paramount in screening, diagnosis, monitoring, and assessing interventions \cite{Cullen2007, Petersen2018}. However, there are several problems and issues associated with existing assessment methods: variability of administration, use of time, cultural response biases, and limitations of access \cite{Prince2013, Cordell2013, Henrich2010, Goldberg2015, Geddes2020, Bilder2020}. 

To address these challenges, this study proposes developing a web-based Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) application. While the MMSE is widely used to detect mild cognitive impairments, it has limitations including cultural biases \cite{Folstein1975, Tombaugh1992}. In this respect, the web-based MMSE method proposed here would aim to increase accessibility, efficiency, and reach to the MMSE test. Consequently, benefiting remote or underserved regions \cite{Bauer2012, Zygouris2017, Seifan2015}.

\subsection{The Aging Population and Cognitive Health}
Europe's demographic landscape is undergoing a significant transformation as a result of its rapidly aging population. Eurostat projections indicate that the proportion of people 65 and older will increase from 20.3\% in 2019 to 29.4\% by 2050 \cite{Eurostat2020}. This demographic change correlates with an increase in age-related cognitive issues, most notably:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Definition:} A condition involving slight but noticeable decline in cognitive abilities.
        \item \textit{Prevalence:} Affects 6--12\% of adults aged 60 and older \cite{Petersen2018}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Dementia:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Various forms are expected to rise significantly with the aging population \cite{Livingston2020}.
        \item Projected to affect nearly 19 million Europeans by 2050 \cite{AlzheimerEurope2019}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These trends highlight the growing importance of cognitive health in the aging population of Europe, emphasizing the need for effective screening and intervention strategies.

The increasing prevalence of cognitive impairment poses significant challenges to healthcare systems, families, and societies. However, early detection and targeted interventions can significantly alter the course of decline. Prompt identification allows healthcare providers to implement strategies that may slow progression, improve quality of life, and alleviate overall stress on healthcare infrastructure \cite{Livingston2020}. This approach creates an opportunity for timely diagnosis, empowering patients and their families to map out future care strategies proactively. It enables them to make informed decisions about the diverse treatment options available through various channels \cite{Sperling2011}.

Considering these views, an emerging need demands efficient, accessible, and trustworthy cognitive assessment tools, enabling mass-scale screening and monitoring of the aging population based on cognitive function. This research necessitates the development of an improved Web-based Mini-Mental State Examination application to enhance accessibility and efficiency in cognitive assessment within clinical and research settings.

\subsection{ The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)}

Cognitive assessment is crucial in detecting and managing cognitive impairments, especially in the elderly. These kinds of tests can check for different kinds of cognitive disorders and give an idea of how bad certain impairments are, so that doctors can see how the disease is getting worse and see what treatments are working. These tools make early detection possible and initiate timely intervention, stopping deterioration and improving quality of life, in addition to providing essential information for studies on cognitive aging \cite{Langa2015, Petersen2018, Weintraub2009}. Even though it is relevant, the administration of cognitive assessment has faced a variety of challenges: variability across settings, time-consuming paper-and-pencil methods, cultural and linguistic biases, and remote assessment-related complications \cite{Prince2013, Cordell2013, Henrich2010, Goldberg2015, Geddes2020, Bilder2020}.

Folstein et al. \cite{Folstein1975} developed the MMSE in 1975, becoming a standard cognitive screening tool in clinical practice and research. Test items cover various cognitive domains, such as orientation, attention, memory, language, and visuospatial skills of a subject \cite{Folstein1975, Tombaugh1992, Shulman2006}. In most cases, clinicians perform the test face-to-face with individuals asking them to complete tasks ranging from a subject's cognitive orientation to visual construction. The advantages of MMSE are its ease of administration and its high sensitivity toward moderate to severe levels of cognitive impairments. Nevertheless, it is known to be relatively insensitive to mild impairments, to have cultural biases, and is limited in measuring executive functions \cite{Folstein1975}.

The need to overcome traditional assessment limitations and address challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need for remote healthcare solutions, drives the move towards a web-based MMSE. A web-based MMSE can increase accessibility, reduce administration time, and enable remote patient monitoring, enhancing the ability to track changes over time \cite{Bauer2012, Seifan2015, Zygouris2017, Geddes2020, Cullum2014, Lim2020, Harrington2021}. Modern cognitive evaluations have embraced technologies, such as AI, in personalization and innovating test procedures that capture subtle changes in cognitive function. However, challenges accompany these digital versions of MMSE, including the still-existing digital divide among older adults, concerns about data security, and validation against traditional evaluation methods \cite{Bilder2020, Wild2021}. Discussion on these challenges remains open in building a robust and widely accepted web-based cognitive assessment tool.\\

\noindent\textbf{The Novelty of the Study:} This research is novel in its approach toward using state-of-the-art AI techniques with Large language models (LLMs) for cognitive assessments. In the current case, a Mixtral-Dolphin 8x7B to be run on Ollama, along with the vision model for tasks that require a visual component and fallbacks from ChatGPT v4, will be utilized. At one's disposal, this armory of technologies recently available creates new opportunities to enhance adaptability, accuracy, and interpretability in cognitive assessments. Equipped with these leading-edge AI technologies, the web-based MMSE will radically change today's traditional cognitive screening and raise a new bar across the discipline. This multi-model approach pushes the envelope on the automation of cognitive assessment, guaranteeing resilience under various cognition and system conditions domains.
