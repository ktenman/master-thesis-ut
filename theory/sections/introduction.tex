Europe is experiencing a demographic shift, with projections indicating that by 2050, 29.4\% of the population will be 65 years or older, contributing to a rise in age-related conditions such as dementia \cite{Eurostat2020, Marques2011}. This shift places a significant burden on healthcare systems, requiring the development of innovative approaches to support the aging population \cite{Zhang2022}. Early detection and intervention in cognitive decline are crucial, as they can substantially affect disease progression and improve quality of life \cite{BlakehurstVet2022}.

However, traditional cognitive assessment tools like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) face limitations due to cultural biases and the need for in-person administration. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and tangible interaction technologies offer promising solutions to these challenges, potentially enhancing the accessibility and effectiveness of cognitive assessments \cite{Marques2011}.

Given these trends, it is essential to address the limitations of traditional methods such as the MMSE, which is widely used for detecting mild cognitive impairments \cite{Folstein1975}. The current study proposes developing a web-based version of the MMSE to enhance accessibility, efficiency, and reach, especially in underserved regions. The digital platform could reduce biases, improve consistency in administration, and allow remote assessments, offering potential benefits in broader population screening and long-term monitoring of cognitive health \cite{Bauer2012, Zygouris2017, Seifan2015}.

\subsection{The Aging Population and Cognitive Health}
Europe's demographic landscape is undergoing a significant transformation due to its rapidly aging population, a change that correlates with an increase in age-related cognitive issues, most notably:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Definition:} A condition involving slight but noticeable decline in cognitive abilities.
        \item \textit{Prevalence:} Affects 6--12\% of adults aged 60 and older \cite{Petersen2018}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Dementia:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Definition:} A complex neurological condition characterized by a substantial deterioration in cognitive abilities, impacting various mental functions including memory, reasoning, and communication skills \cite{WHO2023}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

These trends highlight the growing importance of cognitive health in the aging population of Europe, emphasizing the need for effective screening and intervention strategies.

The increasing prevalence of cognitive impairment poses significant challenges to healthcare systems, families, and societies. However, early detection and targeted interventions can significantly alter the course of decline. Prompt identification allows healthcare providers to implement strategies that may slow progression, improve quality of life, and alleviate overall stress on healthcare infrastructure \cite{Livingston2020}. This approach creates an opportunity for timely diagnosis, empowering patients and their families to map out future care strategies proactively. It enables them to make informed decisions about the diverse treatment options available through various channels \cite{Sperling2011}.

Considering these views, an emerging need demands efficient, accessible, and trustworthy cognitive assessment tools, enabling mass-scale screening and monitoring of the aging population based on cognitive function. This research necessitates the development of an improved web-based Mini-Mental State Examination application to enhance accessibility and efficiency in cognitive assessment within clinical and research settings.

\subsection{The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)}

Cognitive assessment is crucial in detecting and managing cognitive impairments, especially in the elderly. These kinds of tests can check for different kinds of cognitive disorders and give an idea of how bad certain impairments are, so that doctors can see how the disease is getting worse and see what treatments are working. These tools make early detection possible and initiate timely intervention, stopping deterioration and improving quality of life, in addition to providing essential information for studies on cognitive aging \cite{Langa2015, Petersen2018, Weintraub2009}. Even though it is relevant, the administration of cognitive assessment has faced a variety of challenges: variability across settings, time-consuming paper-and-pencil methods, cultural and linguistic biases, and remote assessment-related complications \cite{Prince2013, Cordell2013, Henrich2010, Goldberg2015, Geddes2020, Bilder2020}.

Folstein et al. \cite{Folstein1975} developed the MMSE in 1975, becoming a standard cognitive screening tool in clinical practice and research. Test items cover various cognitive domains, such as orientation, attention, memory, language, and visuospatial skills of a subject \cite{Folstein1975, Tombaugh1992, Shulman2006}. In most cases, clinicians perform the test face-to-face with individuals asking them to complete tasks ranging from a subject's cognitive orientation to visual construction. The advantages of MMSE are its ease of administration and its high sensitivity toward moderate to severe levels of cognitive impairments. Nevertheless, it is known to be relatively insensitive to mild impairments, to have cultural biases, and is limited in measuring executive functions \cite{Folstein1975}.

The need to overcome traditional assessment limitations and address challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the need for remote healthcare solutions, drives the move towards a web-based MMSE. A web-based MMSE can increase accessibility, reduce administration time, and enable remote patient monitoring, enhancing the ability to track changes over time \cite{Bauer2012, Seifan2015, Zygouris2017, Geddes2020, Cullum2014, Lim2020, Harrington2021}. Modern cognitive evaluations have embraced technologies, such as AI, in personalization and innovating test procedures that capture subtle changes in cognitive function. However, challenges accompany these digital versions of MMSE, including the still-existing digital divide among older adults, concerns about data security, and validation against traditional evaluation methods \cite{Bilder2020, Wild2021}. Discussing these challenges remains open to building a robust and widely accepted web-based cognitive assessment tool.\\

\noindent\textbf{The Novelty of the Study:} This research introduces a novel approach to cognitive assessments by employing state-of-the-art AI techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, the study utilizes the Llama 3.1:70B model, executed on the Ollama platform, in conjunction with a vision model for tasks requiring visual processing. Additionally, fallback mechanisms from ChatGPT 4o are integrated to ensure robustness across diverse assessment scenarios. This advanced suite of technologies enhances cognitive assessments' adaptability, accuracy, and interpretability, setting a new standard in the field. Adding these advanced AI technologies to the web-based MMSE is meant to improve traditional ways of testing cognitive abilities. This will push the limits of automation and ensure the test works well in a wide range of cognitive and system conditions.

\subsection{Research Objectives}
