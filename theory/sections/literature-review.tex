Cognitive assessment is crucial in diagnosing and managing various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Technological advancements have driven a significant evolution in cognitive assessment methods and tools, progressing from traditional paper-and-pencil tests to sophisticated computerized, web-based, and AI-assisted approaches. This review examines this evolution, providing a comprehensive overview of traditional and modern cognitive assessment techniques. It analyzes the strengths and limitations of various methods, explores how recent innovations have improved accessibility and utility, and addresses the ethical considerations surrounding integrating new technologies in cognitive testing.

\subsection{The MMSE}
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), developed by Folstein et al. in 1975, has become a cornerstone of cognitive assessment \cite{Folstein1975}. This widely used screening tool provides a quick and standardized method for assessing cognitive function across various domains, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item orientation to time and place;
\item registration and recall;
\item attention and calculation;
\item language (naming, repetition, comprehension);
\item visuospatial abilities.
\end{itemize}

The MMSE's strength lies in its ability to quickly screen for global cognitive impairment, typically taking 5-10 minutes to administer. This efficiency has contributed to its widespread adoption in clinical settings, particularly in primary care and geriatric medicine \cite{Crum1993}. However, recent research emphasizes the growing role of AI in enhancing traditional cognitive assessment methods like the MMSE, potentially increasing their accuracy and scope \cite{Veneziani2024}.

\subsubsection{MMSE Selection Rationale}
Several factors influence the decision to develop a web-based AI solution based on the MMSE:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Widespread adoption and standardization:} The MMSE provides a standardized framework familiar to many clinicians and researchers \cite{Folstein1975, Crum1993}.
\item \textbf{Efficiency and ease of use:} Its quick administration makes it suitable for integration into a web-based platform \cite{Tombaugh1992}.
\item \textbf{Comprehensive initial screening:} The MMSE covers a wide range of cognitive domains, making it effective for initial screening \cite{Tombaugh1992}.
\item \textbf{Established clinical utility:} Numerous studies have validated the MMSE's effectiveness in diagnosing cognitive impairments and tracking changes over time \cite{Salmon1990, Mitchell2009}. Furthermore, recent advances have shown that AI-enhanced MMSE can offer even greater diagnostic precision, especially in the early detection of conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) \cite{Formica2023}.
\item \textbf{Adaptability to digital platforms:} The MMSE's structured format makes it adaptable to digital platforms and AI automation \cite{Zygouris2017}.
\end{itemize}

While other cognitive assessments, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), are also widely used, the MMSE was chosen for this web-based AI solution due to its widespread adoption, ease of use, and established clinical utility. The MMSE’s structure is particularly well-suited for digital adaptation, allowing for a seamless transition to a web-based platform \cite{Peng2020}. This adaptability is increasingly relevant as AI integration in cognitive assessments grows, allowing for more personalized and context-aware applications.

\subsubsection{MMSE Scoring and Significance}
The MMSE is scored on a scale of 30 points, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. Generally, scores are interpreted as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 24-30: normal cognitive function;
\item 18-23: mild cognitive impairment;
\item 0-17: severe cognitive impairment.
\end{itemize}
These cutoff points should be interpreted cautiously, considering factors such as age, education, and cultural background \cite{Kukull1994}.

\subsubsection{Limitations and Criticisms}
Despite its utility, the MMSE has several limitations:
\begin{itemize}
\item ceiling effect in high-functioning individuals;
\item limited sensitivity to mild cognitive impairment;
\item influence of education and cultural factors on performance;
\item inadequate assessment of executive function;
\item practice effects with repeated administration.
\end{itemize}
The ceiling effect and cultural bias can lead to potential missed diagnoses or misclassifications \cite{FrancoMarina2010, Kim2010}. The limited assessment of executive function is particularly problematic for early detection of certain types of cognitive impairment \cite{Diamond2013}. Although the MoCA addresses some of these limitations by including more challenging tasks, the MMSE was selected due to its established clinical utility and easier integration into digital platforms. Furthermore, AI-enhanced tools, such as the Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT), demonstrate the potential to overcome some of these limitations by providing more detailed analyses of cognitive functions \cite{Jiménez-Mesa2023}.

\subsection{Digital Cognitive Assessment}
The transition from conventional paper-and-pencil tests to computerized platforms and, more recently, web-based applications has been a defining feature of cognitive assessment tools evolution. This transition has significantly improved the administration, accuracy, and accessibility of cognitive assessments \cite{Bauer2012, Zygouris2017}.

\subsubsection{Advantages}

\end{itemize}

These innovations enhance the engagement, efficiency, and individual tailoring of cognitive tests. For instance, recent advancements in gamification have significantly improved user engagement and data quality by transforming assessments into interactive experiences \cite{Bowers2021}.

Web-based assessments substantially improve the potential for longitudinal monitoring of cognitive changes \cite{Wild2021}. The convenience of home-based testing facilitates more frequent assessments, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
\item monitoring cognitive decline progression;
\item evaluating intervention effectiveness;
\item detecting subtle changes in cognitive performance;
\item supporting early detection and intervention.
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive view of cognitive health over time allows for more informed decision-making in cognitive health management \cite{Zygouris2017}.

A groundbreaking study by Dagum \cite{Dagum2018} showcased the potential of passive data collection through smartphones for cognitive assessment. By analyzing phone usage patterns and sensor data, researchers were able to detect fluctuations in cognitive function with high precision. This approach opens up new avenues for continuous and unobtrusive cognitive monitoring in real-world environments.

\subsubsection{Challenges}
Despite their advantages, digital cognitive assessments face several challenges:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
Addressing these challenges is crucial for the widespread adoption and effective use of digital cognitive assessments.

A recent study by Feenstra \cite{Feenstra2017} highlighted the potential for cheating in unsupervised web-based cognitive assessments. The researchers found that a small but significant proportion of participants sought external assistance or used prohibited aids during online tests. This underscores the need for robust measures to ensure test integrity in digital assessment environments.

\subsection{AI in Assessment}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance cognitive assessments by automating scoring processes, providing detailed interpretations of test results, predicting cognitive decline, and personalizing assessments based on individual characteristics and performance. AI algorithms can analyze large datasets to identify subtle patterns and correlations, providing more accurate and objective evaluations. Machine learning models can be trained to recognize early markers of cognitive decline, potentially supporting early intervention and proactive management of cognitive health \cite{Rabinowitz2019}.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 \cite{Openai2023gpt4}, have significant potential in cognitive assessment. These models can understand and generate human-like text, facilitating the development of sophisticated and adaptive testing environments, generating a wide range of questions and prompts, and analyzing verbal and written responses, providing detailed insights into language and communication skills. Other AI techniques, including machine learning and neural networks, enhance the accuracy and reliability of cognitive assessments by continually learning from new data. These techniques can improve the sensitivity and specificity of cognitive evaluations, potentially identifying subtle cognitive changes that might be missed by traditional assessment methods.

\subsubsection{AI Applications and Ethics}
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision are two AI technologies with transformative potential in cognitive assessment:
\begin{itemize}
\item NLP applications include automated analysis of speech patterns, sentiment analysis, extraction of semantic content from free-form responses, and automated scoring of verbal fluency tasks \cite{Weiner2016}.
\item some ways computer vision is used are to automatically grade visuospatial tasks, analyze facial expressions and eye movements during cognitive tests, observe test-taking behaviors in unsupervised settings, and recognize gestures for more interactive cognitive tasks.
\end{itemize}
These technologies enhance the scope and depth of cognitive evaluations, providing comprehensive insights into an individual's cognitive health.

A groundbreaking study by Petti et al. \cite{Petti2020} demonstrated the potential of AI-powered speech analysis to detect cognitive impairment. By applying machine learning algorithms to analyze various acoustic and linguistic characteristics of speech samples, the researchers could accurately differentiate between healthy individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment. This approach offers a non-invasive and potentially more sensitive method for the early detection of cognitive decline.

The integration of AI into cognitive assessment offers numerous potential benefits:

\item potential exacerbation of healthcare disparities due to unequal access to AI technologies \cite{Obermeyer2019};
\item challenges in ensuring the reliability and validity of AI-based assessments across diverse populations \cite{Gianfrancesco2018}.
\end{itemize}

Addressing these ethical concerns is crucial for the responsible development and implementation of AI in cognitive assessment. Efforts are needed to ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI systems, as well as to develop guidelines for the ethical use of AI in clinical practice.

\subsubsection{AI Techniques for Cognitive Assessment}
Several case studies illustrate the successful integration of AI in cognitive assessment:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT):} An AI-enhanced version of the traditional clock drawing test, using machine learning to analyze digital pen strokes for a more detailed and objective assessment of cognitive function \cite{Davis2017}.
\item \textbf{Speech-based assessments:} AI systems that detect early signs of cognitive decline by analyzing speech patterns, offering a non-invasive and easily administered screening tool \cite{Fraser2019}.
\item \textbf{Adaptive cognitive testing:} AI-powered platforms that dynamically adjust task difficulty in real-time based on performance, improving assessment efficiency and accuracy \cite{Zorluoglu2020}.
\item \textbf{Computer vision for facial expression analysis:} AI systems that analyze micro-expressions and eye movements during tasks, providing insights into cognitive processing and emotional states \cite{Bandara2018}.
\end{itemize}

These studies demonstrate AI's potential to enhance the sensitivity, efficiency, and accessibility of cognitive assessments. For example, Zorluoglu et al. \cite{Zorluoglu2020} showed that an AI-powered adaptive testing platform could dynamically adjust task difficulty, resulting in more efficient and accurate assessments than traditional fixed-item tests, particularly for individuals at the extremes of cognitive ability.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
